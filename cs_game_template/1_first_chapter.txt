*comment --== SCENE VARIABLES ==--
*comment todo I typically put scene variables (that you create with *temp) at the top of the scene file instead of scattering them throughout the scene.

*comment --== CHAPTER 1 ==--
*label start_of_chapter_1
*comment todo I like to put labels like this at the top of the file so I can search for them and get to them quickly.

*comment todo I find it helpful to have labels to make it easy to find them.
*label scene_name_of_a_scene

*comment todo A scene goes here

*label scene_name_of_another_scene

*comment todo A scene goes here

*label scene_name_of_yet_another_scene

*comment todo A scene goes here

*finish

*comment todo if you need any subroutines in the startup file, put them here. Otherwise, you can delete this section (including the label)

*comment --== SUBROUTINES ==--
*label subroutines
