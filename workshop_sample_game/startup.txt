It is time. The dragon awaits. Who will you take with you on this epic adventure?

*choice
    #Bernice the Brave.
        *set companion_name "bernice"
        *set companion_e 1
        *set trait_bold %+ 10
        Bernice stands to attention. "Ready to join you!"
    #Walla the Wise.
        *set companion_name "walla"
        *set companion_e 2
        *set trait_wise %+ 10
        Walla nods. "Of course I'll come with you."
    #Maris the Meek.
        "Are you sure?" Maris asks. "Wouldn't you rather take Walla? Or Bernice?"

        *choice
            #"I'm sure, Maris."
                *set companion_name "maris"
                *set companion_e 3
                *set trait_bold %- 10
                Maris isn't excited about this, but sighs and says, "Fine."
            #"I can take Bernice instead."
                *set companion_name "bernice"
                *set companion_e 1
                *set trait_bold %+ 10
                "I'd be honored to join you," Bernice says,
                *goto maris_is_relieved
            #"Walla, why don't you come, then?"
                *set companion_name "walla"
                *set companion_e 2
                *set trait_wise %+ 10
                "Of course," Walla says,
                *label maris_is_relieved
                much to Maris's relief.

You set off with $!{companion_name} to brave the dragon.
@{companion_e "I can't wait to see this dragon!" Bernice says.|"We will have to be clever in dealing with the dragon," Walla says.|"What if we didn't go to see the dragon?" Maris asks.}

All too quickly you arrive at the dragon's house. As you knock, he noses open the very large door to his very large cottage. "Yes?"

Now that it's time to ask him out on a date, you're not sure of the best approach.

*choice
    #Boldly ask the dragon on a date.
        *comment todo
        *if trait_bold > 50
            *comment todo success

        *if trait_wise > 50
            *comment todo success
        *else

    #Meekly request that the dragon consider going on a date with you.
